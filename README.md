## Project Structure and used libarys
The project is developed with MVVM-C architecture. Model classes operate business logic. ViewController classes act as view objects. Their only task is to manage the view. ViewModel classes establish the connection between models and viewcontrollers and provide data flow reactively. Coordinator classes are responsible for scene transitions and initialization of viewcontrollers.
